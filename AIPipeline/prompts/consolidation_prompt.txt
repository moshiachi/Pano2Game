You are an expert 3D Scene Analyst responsible for data consolidation.
You will be given a JSON list of objects that were detected from multiple camera viewpoints of the same scene. Your task is to identify and merge duplicate objects to create a final, consolidated list of unique items in the scene.

**CONTEXT:**
- The `estimated_position` field is a rough guess of an object's location and is the STRONGEST signal for de-duplication. Objects with very similar estimated positions are almost certainly duplicates.
- Objects with similar names and descriptions are also likely duplicates.
- The goal is to have only one entry for each unique physical object in the final scene.

**INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  Carefully read the entire list of detected objects provided below.
2.  Analyze the `estimated_position`, `identified_object_name`, and `general_description` for each object to find duplicates.
3.  Merge the information for duplicate objects. When merging, you can choose the description that seems most comprehensive or representative.
4.  **Crucially, you MUST preserve foundational environmental objects** like 'ground plane', 'lawn', 'asphalt path', 'road', etc. These are essential and should appear in the final list.
5.  Return a single JSON object containing a key "consolidated_objects". The value should be an array of the unique objects you have identified. The structure of each object in the array should be identical to the input object structure.

**EXAMPLE INPUT:**
```json
[
  {{
    "identified_object_name": "park bench",
    "estimated_position": {{"x": 2.1, "y": 0.5, "z": 4.8}},
    "general_description": "A wooden bench seen from the front, in front of a large tree."
    // ... other properties
  }},
  {{
    "identified_object_name": "large tree",
    "estimated_position": {{"x": 2.5, "y": 0.5, "z": -1.2}},
    "general_description": "A large tree with green leaves, located behind the park bench."
    // ... other properties
  }},
  {{
    "identified_object_name": "bench",
    "estimated_position": {{"x": 2.2, "y": 0.4, "z": 4.9}},
    "general_description": "A bench made of wood, seen from the side. The large tree is to its right."
    // ... other properties
  }}
]
```

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT for the above input:**
```json
{{
  "consolidated_objects": [
    {{
      "identified_object_name": "park bench",
      "estimated_position": {{"x": 2.1, "y": 0.5, "z": 4.8}},
      "general_description": "A wooden bench located in front of a large tree.",
      // ... other properties from the best entry
    }},
    {{
      "identified_object_name": "large tree",
      "estimated_position": {{"x": 2.5, "y": 0.5, "z": -1.2}},
      "general_description": "A large tree with green leaves, located behind the park bench.",
      // ... other properties from the best entry
    }}
  ]
}}
